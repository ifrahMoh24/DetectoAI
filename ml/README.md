# SmartCheck – ML & Dataset

This project contains the dataset and training code for SmartCheck, a smartphone defect detection system using a YOLO model.

## Structure

- `dataset/` – images grouped into classes: crack, scratch, dent, pristine
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter/Colab notebooks for data prep, training, and evaluation
- `results/` – metrics, confusion matrices, and sample predictions

## Next Steps

- Finish collecting and cleaning images in each class
- Upload the dataset to Roboflow and annotate
- Train YOLOv8 on Google Colab
